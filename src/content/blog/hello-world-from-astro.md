Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

This is just a simple post to help me understand how Astro works. I'm exploring its concepts, how files are loaded, and how layouts tie everything together. It's fascinating to see how Markdown integrates seamlessly with components and how Astro handles the magic behind the scenes.

Cheers to more Astro adventures! ðŸš€
